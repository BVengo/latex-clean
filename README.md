# Latex Clean
This script has been created to clear a directory of all extra files generated by latemk. It was designed for use with LaTeX Workshop in VS Code, but is probably helpful elsewhere too.
Currently it removes the following files:
- \.aux
- \.bbl
- \.bcf
- \.blg
- \.fdb_latexmk
- \.fls
- \.log
- \.run
- \.xml
- \.gz

## Usage
latex-clean \[-h\] \[dir\]  

positional arguments: 
- dir: Directory to be cleaned. Defaults to the current directory.

optional arguments:
- -h, --help: Show this help message and exit.
